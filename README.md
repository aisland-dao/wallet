# Aisland Wallet

The purpose of this project is to use a Linux Phone as cold wallet [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/)
The transactions are transmitted by QR code between the Cold Wallet and "Watching" wallet like Metamask.

Linux operating system is much more safe of Android and iOS:
- Android Os is built up from 10 gigabyte of source code, basically impossible to audit.
- iOS is closed source, you have to rely on what Apple declares.
-  Linux is the most safe os and it can be customised to reduce the attack surface at the minimum.

The Android/iOS Phones can be kept disconnected but it's a software function and trojan could use the network in stealth way.
The Pinephone has a super cool hardware switch  to disconnect any kind of network.
